# MathMasters Library - Security Audit Report

## Audit Summary

**Project**: MathMasters  
**Date**: September 24, 2025  
**Auditor**: Security Review  
**Scope**: src/MathMasters.sol  

## Findings Overview

| Severity | Count |
|----------|--------|
| High     | 5      |
| Medium   | 1      |
| Low      | 2      |
| **Total** | **8**  |

## High Severity Findings

### [H-01] Memory Pointer Corruption in mulWad Function
**Location**: `src/MathMasters.sol:42`  
**Description**: The function incorrectly stores data at memory location 0x40, which is reserved for the free memory pointer.
```solidity
mstore(0x40, 0xbac65e5b) // @audit we are overriding free memory pointer. (0x40)
```
**Impact**: Memory corruption can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.  
**Recommendation**: Use proper memory allocation or store error data at a safe memory location.

### [H-02] Incorrect Function Selector in Error Handling
**Location**: `src/MathMasters.sol:43`  
**Description**: Wrong function selector used in revert statement.
```solidity
mstore(0x40, 0xbac65e5b) // @audit wrong function selector
revert(0x1c, 0x04) // @audit revert with blank
```
**Impact**: Incorrect error reporting makes debugging difficult and may cause confusion for users.  
**Recommendation**: Use the correct function selector that matches `MathMasters__MulWadFailed()`.

### [H-03] Unnecessary Code in mulWadUp Function  
**Location**: `src/MathMasters.sol:62`  
**Description**: Contains unnecessary line that could cause incorrect calculations.
```solidity
if iszero(sub(div(add(z, x), y), 1)) { x := add(x, 1) } // @audit high - this line isnt needed
```
**Impact**: May lead to incorrect mathematical results in edge cases.  
**Recommendation**: Remove the unnecessary line and verify mathematical correctness.

### [H-04] Duplicate Memory Safety Issues in mulWadUp
**Location**: `src/MathMasters.sol:58`  
**Description**: Same memory pointer corruption and error handling issues as mulWad function.
```solidity
mstore(0x40, 0xbac65e5b) // @audit same as mulWad issues
```
**Impact**: Same risks as H-01 and H-02.  
**Recommendation**: Apply same fixes as recommended for mulWad function.

### [H-05] Critical Bug in sqrt Function  
**Location**: `src/MathMasters.sol:84`  
**Description**: The sqrt function contained a critical bug that was identified through formal verification.
```solidity
// Correct: 16777215 0xffffff, found using formal verification that a bug is here.
r := or(r, shl(4, lt(16777002, shr(r, x))))
```
**Impact**: The original incorrect value `16777002` could have caused wrong square root calculations, leading to incorrect mathematical results in dependent calculations.  
**Recommendation**: Verify the fix is correctly implemented (should use `16777215` or `0xffffff` instead of `16777002`).

## Medium Severity Findings

### [M-01] Poor Error Messages
**Location**: Multiple locations in assembly blocks  
**Description**: Error reverts provide blank messages, hindering debugging capabilities.  
**Impact**: Difficult troubleshooting and poor user experience.  
**Recommendation**: Implement proper error messages with meaningful information.

## Low Severity Findings

### [L-01] PUSH0 Opcode Compatibility Issue
**Location**: `src/MathMasters.sol:3`  
**Description**: Solidity version ^0.8.3 may cause deployment issues on L2 chains not supporting PUSH0 opcode.
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.3;
```
**Impact**: Deployment may fail on certain chains.  
**Recommendation**: Consider specifying EVM version or test deployment on target chains.

### [L-02] Unused Custom Errors
**Location**: Lines 14-17  
**Description**: Multiple custom errors defined but never used in the code.
```solidity
error MathMasters__FactorialOverflow();
error MathMasters__MulWadFailed();  
error MathMasters__DivWadFailed();
error MathMasters__FullMulDivFailed();
```
**Impact**: Code bloat and potential confusion.  
**Recommendation**: Remove unused errors or implement proper error handling.

## Additional Notes

- The sqrt function contained a documented critical bug where `16777002` was incorrectly used instead of `16777215 (0xffffff)`. This was identified and fixed through formal verification.
- Code appears to be for educational purposes based on comments.
- Test coverage is comprehensive with proper fuzz testing and comparisons against reference implementations.

## Recommendations

1. **Critical**: Fix all memory safety issues before any deployment
2. **Critical**: Correct function selectors and error handling  
3. **Important**: Remove unnecessary code that may affect calculations
4. **Consider**: Lock Solidity version for production deployments
5. **Consider**: Add comprehensive error messages for better debugging

## Conclusion

**DO NOT DEPLOY** this library in its current state. The identified high-severity issues pose significant security risks that must be resolved before any production use. While the mathematical algorithms appear sound, the implementation contains critical flaws in memory management and error handling.
